Depending on the stream taken, students may also be able to teach the 4500 students studying Society and Culture in NSW or English language to the 25% of Australian students that have English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EALD) (NSW Education Standards Authority, 2021 HSC Enrolments by Course, 2021).

The combined ""Vertical Stack"" course (undergraduate + postgraduate degree) enables students to gain a greater depth of disciplinary knowledge in Communications (Writing and Publishing) before commencing their teaching subjects in the Master of Teaching from their second year of study. Gaining a wider and deeper understanding in their field of study gives students more confidence when they commence teaching. They enter the classroom up to date on the most current developments in the discipline, and this is highly valued by schools.

The unique vertical structure of this combined course means students do not need to meet the standard three Band 5 HSC results, including English, for admission to an initial teacher education course.

To ensure that a high quality of teachers is maintained in the education sector, students need to achieve a Credit average in the first two years of their university studies before progressing into the final years of the program.

If students do not meet the Credit average, they can still continue in the Bachelor of Communications (Writing and Publishing) and graduate with that qualification.

Students spend 80 days in one of more than 200 secondary schools across NSW. This practical experience with a trusted UTS partner school helps them gain the skills and confidence in curriculum and classroom management required for effective teaching in English (and EALD or Society and Culture if relevant), and also helps them develop personal and professional networks within and beyond education for their future career path.

Not only are students accelerated in their career pathway to secondary teaching by achieving two qualifications, including one at postgraduate level, within the duration of a single undergraduate degree, they also have the benefits of a range of career options.

There is a strong interrelation between the progress of engineering and developments in science, and a demonstrated need for professionals with a strong understanding and experience in both areas. Engineers with Medical Scientist training have careers that are dynamic and involve an exciting range of professions from research and development, writing and implementing policy and practice in the medical and health sciences, to working in industry, government, and the innovation sector. This course allows choice or majors within both the Medical Scientist and Engineering programs, so students can specialise to their interests.

The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) program has a core taken by all engineering students which provides the foundation knowledge and skills required of every engineer. Students choose a major which is where they develop the technical knowledge specific to that field of practice. There is a choice of ten majors including Biomedical, Civil, Data, Electrical, Mechanical, Software, and a Flexible major that can be paired with the choice of major in the Bachelor of Medical Science to create a study trajectory that aligns with the student‚Äôs interests and career ambitions.

Medical Scientists at UTS can choose to major in Medical and Health-related Sciences or Pathology, allowing them to have speciality relevant to their career choices and interests. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories and studios with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, innovation and team-work to deliver impact across local and global communities.

A strong professional focus ensures graduates of this course learn the skills employers want with a solid link between theory and practice and the benefits of hands-on experience. Students explore and investigate the human body's structure, function and disease processes at the cellular and whole organ level.

Creative intelligence and innovation training utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.

This course provides students with a thorough understanding of how forensic science can solve and prevent crime. This is a hands-on course using world-class facilities that are modelled on operational laboratories. The course is well regarded nationally and internationally, with strong links to industries such as the federal and state police services, national and international forensic institutions, and government laboratories.

By focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.
