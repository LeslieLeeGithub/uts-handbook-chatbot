  "overview": "The Master of Phillosophy in Medical Biotechnology provides students with a unique opportunity to undertake original research and gain in-depth knowledge in their particular scientific field. Students have access to staff that are leading researchers and experts in their field. Undertaking this course allows students to explore their research potential and develop research skills. This course is designed to provide a scholarship pathway to the PhD program.\n\nThe course contains a compulsory core of professional subjects relevant to all science disciplines. The subjects in the core provide a backbone of skills important to a professional scientist; be they engaged in research, science businesses, industries or government organisations. These are the skills of communication, critical analysis, project management and innovation and commercialisation. The professional stream has options for specialised professional skills development and is complemented by medical biotechnology study.\n\nThe second half of the course comprises a substantial research component, giving students an opportunity to undertake original, cutting-edge research. For students with suitable achievement levels, this provides a direct pathway to a PhD, and carries points that can be used in the scholarship application process.",
