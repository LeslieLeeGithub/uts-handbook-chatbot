  "overview": "The Bachelor of Health Science Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Health Science Bachelor of International Studies (C10396).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nThis combined degree is characterised by a strong emphasis on the social model of health and combines health-specific content with a mix of professional and scientific subjects. In majors, students can gain an in-depth understanding of Indigenous health or health promotion. Alternatively, students can develop their knowledge of global and international health priorities to contribute to overseas health initiatives and aid organisations. Students who complete this course with the required pathway and grade point average also meet current entry criteria for the UTS Master of Physiotherapy.",
