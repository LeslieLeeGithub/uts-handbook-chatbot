  "overview": "The Master of Planning provides a new career path for design, planning and property professionals, equipping graduates with a broad understanding of planning issues alongside the negotiation skills and creative thinking required to resolve them.\n\nWhereas planning has often been seen as an approval process, UTS approaches the discipline as a critical task, one that connects communities with governments, institutions and developers.\n\nThrough this course, students proactively engage with policy, environmental and demographic frameworks to understand how planning decisions shape the urban environment over the long term. This engagement is multidisciplinary, spanning planning, urban design, property, architecture/landscape architecture, economics, spatial analysis, law and urban ecology.\n\nWith UTS, the Master of Planning may also be studied as a combined degree incorporating property development, the UTS Master of Property Development and Planning.",
