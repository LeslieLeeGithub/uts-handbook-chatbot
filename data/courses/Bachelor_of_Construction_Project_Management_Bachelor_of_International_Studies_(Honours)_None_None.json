  "overview": "The Bachelor of Construction Project Management Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Construction Project Management Bachelor of International Studies (C10215).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nThe emphasis on the utilisation of digital technologies, such as building information modelling, ensures that students understand the leading-edge advances being implemented in the industry. This knowledge can be applied in other industry sectors, providing even further employment opportunities.\n\nAll students are required to complete a minimum of 200 days' industry experience during the course, providing essential professional exposure. For the vast majority of students this entails paid employment in the industry with contractors and consultants (typically called cadetships). To broaden their personal and professional outlook, students can also choose electives, or a sub-major in a range of disciplines, outside construction project management, including business accounting, environmental studies and Aboriginal studies.",
