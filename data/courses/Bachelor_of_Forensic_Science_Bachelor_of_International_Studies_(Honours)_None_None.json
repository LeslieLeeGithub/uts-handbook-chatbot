  "overview": "The Bachelor of Forensic Science Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Forensic Science Bachelor of International Studies (C10388).\n\nThe Bachelor of Forensic Science Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) prepares students for professional and specialist work in the discipline of forensic science. Students build a solid foundation of skills and knowledge in the enabling sciences, complemented by an in-depth understanding of forensic science in the context of their chosen discipline. Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills is a focus of the degree, with graduates in high demand from a diverse range of industries and organisations.\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nThis course provides students with a thorough understanding of how forensic science can solve and prevent crime. This is a hands-on course using world-class facilities that are modelled on operational laboratories. The course is well regarded nationally and internationally, with strong links to industries such as the federal and state police services, national and international forensic institutions, and government laboratories.",
