  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Fashion and Textiles is an internationally recognised degree that gives students the start they need to pursue careers across all facets of the local and international fashion industry. The degree provides the conceptual knowledge and garment-making skills required to transform a creative vision into compelling fashion statements. Sustainability and social justice are threaded throughout the course.\n\nWhile UTS recognises that a commercial framework is important, students are encouraged to become industry leaders through a focus on innovation, experimentation, systems thinking and futuring methodologies. They have full access to world-class textile and fashion workshops, working under the close supervision of expert staff. This experimental spirit is balanced by close industry ties. Students get the opportunity to work on real-world projects with brands such as Australian Wool Innovation, Liberty London, ISKO Denim and Swarovski.\n\nUTS also understands that the fashion industry is as much about people as it is about garments: through studio work and subjects in Design Studies students gain the communication and teamwork skills to develop, articulate and present their ideas to peers and industry. Graduates are recognised globally and many have gone on to work or study overseas, including fashion capitals London, New York, Tokyo and Milan. Leading international designers employing UTS graduates include Alexander McQueen, Kenzo, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Helmut Lang.",
