  "overview": "The Undergraduate Certificate in Science is a six month program designed to build foundational knowledge and skills in science. Students can acquire new skills that boost their employability or provide an alternative pathway to UTS Science degree programs and training in much needed STEM areas. The course gives students the opportunity to study first year Science subjects that match their area of scientific interest. They can then articulate their certificate into a UTS undergraduate degree in science in either the Life Sciences (e.g. in medical sciences, biotechnology, environmental sciences) or the Physical Sciences (e.g. physics, chemistry, mathematics, forensics). The Undergraduate Certificate in Science constitutes 24 credit points of study in either Autumn or Spring session first year subjects. Students are enrolled alongside full degree students and experience the same blend of online and on campus learning activities, have the same access to University resources such as the library, social clubs, student services and participate in orientation activities. Students engage in a personalised learning experience which stimulates their interest in further study and lifelong learning. Students who graduate from the course receive recognition of prior learning (RPL) in their course of choice should they choose to follow a pathway to continue their studies. If students choose not to pursue further studies, they already have developed important employability skills such as critical and scientific thinking, problem solving, basic communication and practical skills.",
