  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Architecture is the first of two degrees needed to become an architect. Students wishing to qualify for professional recognition as an architect must also complete the Master of Architecture (C04235). UTS architecture courses provide the skills and knowledge necessary to practise in the architectural profession and to be a future leader in the design of the built environment.\n\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\n\nThe Bachelor of Design in Architecture provides students with a rich education oriented towards international practice and design experimentation. Teaching is hands-on and undertaken in teams using the most innovative digital design and fabrication technologies available to the architectural profession in dedicated studios and workshops. UTS students have the benefit of learning from a cohesive team who are passionate about architecture and engage with the discipline as practitioners, researchers, educators and critics.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.",
