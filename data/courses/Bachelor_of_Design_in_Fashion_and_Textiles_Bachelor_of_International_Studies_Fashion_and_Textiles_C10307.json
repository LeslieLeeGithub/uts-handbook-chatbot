  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Fashion and Textiles is an internationally recognised degree that gives students the start they need to pursue careers across all facets of the international fashion industry. The degree provides the conceptual knowledge and garment-making skills required to transform creative vision into compelling fashion statements.\n\nCombined with the Bachelor of International Studies, the degree provides students with additional practical skills, in particular those that raise their awareness of the international contexts of design, by providing the opportunity to acquire knowledge and understanding of a language other than English and another culture.\n\nWhile UTS recognises that a commercial framework is important, students are encouraged to become industry leaders through a focus on innovation, experimentation, individual expression and the future of fashion. They have full access to world-class textile and fashion workshops, working under the close supervision of expert staff. This experimental spirit is balanced by close industry ties. Students get the opportunity to work on real-world projects with brands such as Jets Swimwear, Think Positive, Australian Wool Innovation, Calcoup Knitwear and Swarovski.\n\nUTS also understands that the fashion industry is as much about people as it is about garments: using studios and interdisciplinary subjects, students gain the communication and teamwork skills to develop, articulate and sell their creations to peers and industry. Graduates are recognised globally and many have gone on to work or study overseas, including fashion capitals London, New York, Tokyo and Milan. Leading international designers employing UTS graduates include Alexander McQueen, Kenzo, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Helmut Lang.\n\nThe international experience of the international studies component further enhances career prospects.",
