  "overview": "Bachelor of Sport and Exercise Management Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Sport and Exercise Management Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) (C10303).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nAs the sport and exercise industry has undergone a period of substantial growth, the need for professionals with management skills and qualifications has become increasingly important. Graduates are equipped with the professional knowledge and skills to operate in one of Australia's most dynamic industries.",
