  "overview": "The Master of Physiotherapy is a two-year, graduate-entry degree leading to eligibility for registration as a physiotherapist in Australia. Innovative and practice-based in approach, the course's core areas of study include musculoskeletal, neurological, orthopaedic and cardiorespiratory physiotherapy across the lifespan.\n\nIn addition to core areas of physiotherapy, students learn about evidence-based and professional practice, interprofessional teamwork and leadership, and undertake a research project. Advanced subjects include treatment of complex patients, health promotion and community rehabilitation. All students develop a professional portfolio designed to reflect professional competencies.\n\nDeveloped by experienced physiotherapy academics, the course's subject matter is delivered in an integrated, student-focused manner, making use of cutting-edge technologies. This course has been developed in consultation with a working party of experienced physiotherapy clinicians in hospitals and private practice. The discipline has strong links with industry.\n\nOver the two-year course students complete approximately 700–800 hours of clinical placement, sourced for them, addressing a variety of client groups across the lifespan. Clinical placements in hospitals and private practice are carefully selected to complement in-class learning and offer supervision by experienced physiotherapists. Students are allocated placements within the Sydney metropolitan area, with potential opportunities also available in rural and regional settings.",
