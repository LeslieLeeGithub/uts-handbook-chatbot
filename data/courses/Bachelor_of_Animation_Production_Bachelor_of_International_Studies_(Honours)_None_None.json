  "overview": "The Bachelor of Animation Production Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Animation Production Bachelor of International Studies (C10462).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nGraduates from the Bachelor of Animation Production are image-makers, critical thinkers and storytellers in equal measure and we help equip them to become leaders in this industry. Students learn to develop, pitch and defend ideas, and ultimately create original content for film, TV, advertising and other screen-based media that will engage global audiences.\n\nOne of the benefits of studying our Bachelor of Animation Production is the link to UTS’s existing industry connections that help give students that competitive advantage. Students have the opportunity to work with live projects and active partners, such as ABC Podcasts, VIVID, the Australia Piano Quartet, and other collaborations with international universities at the Annecy MIFA campus etc. UTS also has long-standing relationships with Sydney's local animation studios such as Flying Bark Productions, Mighty Nice, Cheeky Little Media, Dave Enterprises, and Animal Logic which offer students multiple opportunities to engage in practice while studying.\n\nUTS understands that teamwork is at the heart of the animation industry which is why a studio-led approach is used to create a high-intensity practical environment where students learn how to work with their peers in a professional and collaborative atmosphere, melding creativity, technology and research.",
