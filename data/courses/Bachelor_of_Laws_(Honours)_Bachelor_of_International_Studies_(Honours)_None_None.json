  "overview": "The Bachelor of Laws (Honours) Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Laws (Honours) Bachelor of International Studies (C10458).\n\nIt is offered jointly by UTS Law and UTS International Studies. The course is designed for students who wish to provide specialised legal services to international organisations and to satisfy the demand for lawyers who can act for foreign investors.\n\nFor the Law Honours component students must successfully complete both of the research subjects: 76090 Research Methodology and 76040 Research Thesis. Strong research skills are valued highly in contemporary professional practice.\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nCareer prospects are enhanced by international experience, making students more marketable to prospective employers both locally and internationally.\n\nThe course offers students the opportunity to gain an international perspective to their law studies. In developing language skills and undertaking overseas study in their fourth year, students are exposed to expertise and skills to enable them to work internationally and have an in-depth understanding of cross-cultural legal issues.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to engage in deeper study of the law by studying 76090 Research Methodology and undertaking 76040 Research Thesis. This course can be a pathway to higher degree research programs.",
