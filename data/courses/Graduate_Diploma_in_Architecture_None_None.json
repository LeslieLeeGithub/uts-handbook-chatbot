  "overview": "The Graduate Diploma in Architecture is a focused, one-year exit degree designed for students who begin the Master of Architecture degree, then decide that they do not wish to become licensed architects but still would like qualifications that allow them to work in the profession. The Graduate Diploma is more comprehensive than the Graduate Certificate degree and delivers some of the material that is required to become a practising architect.\n\nStudents engage in complex, real-world design problems that demand they analyse critically, reflect on, synthesise and propose solutions to difficult issues; research and application of established core knowledge in architectural history and theory is tested in the design studio problems as well as in elective subjects; students demonstrate their ability to interpret and transmit knowledge in presentations to expert professionals. These presentations include oral, written, drawn, and built work and simulate the way that graduates will present their work when they are in the field. Throughout the design process, students must demonstrate that they can respond to criticism and exercise their judgment, work autonomously, exercise expert judgment about appropriate design solutions, and offer solutions that are ethical and professional. The Graduate Diploma offers a more comprehensive option than the Graduate Certificate as it is two semesters, opposed to one, so students have more opportunity to hone skills. The Graduate Diploma is embedded in C04235 Master of Architecture, and there is no hierarchy in the AQF level of subjects common to the two courses.",
