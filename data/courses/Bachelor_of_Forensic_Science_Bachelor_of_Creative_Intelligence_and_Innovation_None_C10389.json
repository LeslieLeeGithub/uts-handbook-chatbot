  "overview": "The Bachelor of Forensic Science Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation prepares students for professional and specialist work in the discipline of forensic science. Students build a solid foundation of skills and knowledge in the enabling sciences, complemented by an in-depth understanding of forensic science in the context of their chosen discipline. Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills is a focus of the degree, with graduates in high demand from a diverse range of industries and organisations.\n\nCreative intelligence and innovation training utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\n\nThis course provides students with a thorough understanding of how forensic science can solve and prevent crime. This is a hands-on course using world-class facilities that are modelled on operational laboratories. The course is well regarded nationally and internationally, with strong links to industries such as the federal and state police services, national and international forensic institutions, and government laboratories.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.",
