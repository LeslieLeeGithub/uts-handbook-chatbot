  "overview": "This course is offered jointly by UTS Law and UTS Communication. It aims to develop a broad range of professional skills and knowledge for either legal or media practice and provides advanced hands-on conceptual and technical skills in film, video, sound and new media. It allows students to graduate with the separate degrees of Bachelor of Arts in Communication (Media Arts and Production) and Bachelor of Laws.\n\nHonours relates to the law component only and students must successfully complete both of the research subjects: 76090 Research Methodology and 76040 Research Thesis. Strong research skills are valued highly in contemporary professional practice.\n\nStudents have the unique opportunity to combine studies in film, video, sound and new media with studies in law, gaining a first-hand perspective of the production process, the creation of intellectual property in media production and the functions of various crew roles, including directors and producers through producing and exhibiting their own short film, video, sound production or new media programs.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to engage in deeper study of the law by studying 76090 Research Methodology and undertaking 76040 Research Thesis. This course can be a pathway to higher degree research programs.",
