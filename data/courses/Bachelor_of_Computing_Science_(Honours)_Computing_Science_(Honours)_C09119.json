  "overview": "This course offers a sound education in all aspects of computing science and information technology. It is intended for students who aspire to become researchers or who want a career in a more scientific-oriented computing area. As such it provides a pathway to postgraduate research study.\n\nThis course adopts a practice-based approach to computing science education and the course content is a mix of theory and practice, with a stronger focus on the mathematics appropriate for computing science and research projects. As well as gaining strong technical skills in computing science and IT, students gain skills in problem-solving, teamwork and communication. Students undertake research projects with UTS researchers. Employers look for graduates with strong computing science skills and, in this course, students are exposed to real research problems in computing science and IT.\n\nUTS: Information Technology continues to support part-time study and some subjects can be taken in the evening as well as during the day.",
