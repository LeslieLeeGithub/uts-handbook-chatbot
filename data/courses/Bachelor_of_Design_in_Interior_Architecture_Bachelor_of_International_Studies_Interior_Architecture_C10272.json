  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Interior Architecture helps students to re-imagine interior environments and public spaces in local and global contexts. With a strong emphasis on people's experiences of space and the choice of a major in performative space, this degree equips students with the critical skills required to interrogate and transgress the traditional boundaries of commercial interior design.\n\nCombined with the Bachelor of International Studies, the course provides students with additional practical skills, in particular those that raise their awareness of the international contexts of design, by providing the opportunity to acquire knowledge and understanding of a language other than English and another culture.\n\nThe course equips graduates with critical thinking, creativity and the skills to engage across the expanded field of interior architecture, to take up leading roles in industry. Uniquely, this course emphasises digital technologies of representation and fabrication, internationalisation and design practice. Students also learn a different language and culture, and travel overseas.",
