  "overview": "This course is offered jointly by UTS Law and UTS Communication. It provides students with interdisciplinary knowledge of strategic communication processes and industries – such as advertising and public relations – and their social, economic and political contexts, together with studies in law. It allows students to graduate with the separate degrees of Bachelor of Communication (Strategic Communication) and Bachelor of Laws (Honours).\n\nHonours relates to the law component only and students must successfully complete both of the research subjects: 76090 Research Methodology and 76040 Research Thesis. Strong research skills are valued highly in contemporary professional practice.\n\nThe course provides full-time study for students wishing to obtain a professional legal qualification that satisfies the requirements for admission as a lawyer in NSW together with practical skills and knowledge for contemporary public communication practice. Assessments and a professional industry placement ensure industry relevance and that students are work-ready.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to engage in deeper study of the law by studying 76090 Research Methodology and undertaking 76040 Research Thesis. This course can be a pathway to higher degree research programs.",
