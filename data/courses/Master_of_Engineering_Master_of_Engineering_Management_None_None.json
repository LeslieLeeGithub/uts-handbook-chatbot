  "overview": "This program allows students to complete the Master of Engineering (ME) and the Master of Engineering Management (MEM) in two years of full-time study. The course follows an integrated approach to professional practice through professional engineering subjects, subjects relating to the major, an independent graduate project (in the area of the major), and a set of electives.\n\nThis course is for professional engineers who want to combine the Master of Engineering with a specific major with the Master of Engineering Management. This enables students to gain both technical and management skills in an accelerated way and complete two courses in two years rather than three years individually.",
