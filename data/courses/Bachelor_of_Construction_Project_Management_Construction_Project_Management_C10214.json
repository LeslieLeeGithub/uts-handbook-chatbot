  "overview": "The Bachelor of Construction Project Management delivers the management, technology and process skills required to work in a variety of well-paid roles across the full spectrum of construction projects. Students are taught a wide range of project management methodologies with a strong focus on applying these to real-world projects. This knowledge can be applied in other industry sectors, providing further employment opportunities.\n\nThe emphasis on the utilisation of digital technologies, such as building information modelling, ensures that students understand the leading-edge advances that are being implemented in the industry. All students are required to complete a minimum of 200 days' industry experience during the course, providing essential professional exposure. For the vast majority of students this entails paid employment in the industry with contractors and consultants (typically called cadetships). To broaden their personal and professional outlook, students can also choose electives or a sub-major in a range of disciplines outside construction project management, including business studies, environmental studies, international studies and Aboriginal studies.",
