  "overview": "For those with an interest in different forms of creative writing and publishing, this practice-based course provides the skills and industry knowledge to work in the field. The Bachelor of Communication (Writing and Publishing) at UTS is an industry-led course, designed and taught by a team of award-winning published authors, editors, scholars and industry professionals. Writing and Publishing builds students’ knowledge of Australian and global publishing contexts, as well as writing and storytelling across an array of formats, like fiction and nonfiction, screenwriting, digital content and games. Students also develop strengths in critical thinking, research, editing and publishing and storytelling in broader contexts – all skills transferable to a wide range of industries and careers.\n\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\n\nTo hone their skills, students engage in interactive classes led by skilled practitioners. Subjects often rely on workshopping, with students learning key concepts, applying these to their own writing, and collaborating with other students to provide and receive feedback. In this way the course provides students with a brilliant opportunity to be a part of a unique writer’s studio and develop their craft, finishing with a folio of works covering key forms and genres.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own, across and between other disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate across a rapidly accelerating world of change.",
