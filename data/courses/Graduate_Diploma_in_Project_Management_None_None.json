  "overview": "UTS's Postgraduate Project Management program is designed to enhance the knowledge, experience and careers of both aspiring and experienced project managers.\n\nProspective students are not able to enrol directly in the Graduate Diploma in Project Management and should instead refer to the Graduate Certificate in Project Management, the Master of Project Management or the Master of Property Development and Project Management in order to join the UTS Postgraduate Project Management Program.\n\nThe Graduate Diploma in Project Management is an ‘exit’ option that enables appropriate recognition for students who have completed two-thirds of the Master of Project Management course, but are unable to complete the full course. Students in the Master of Project Management may apply for an internal course transfer to complete with a Graduate Diploma.",
