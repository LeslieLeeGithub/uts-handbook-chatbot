  "overview": "In the science component of this combined degree, students may select any one of nine different specialised programs leading to the award of a science degree naming the chosen discipline, or students may select a range of science subjects to tailor their study according to their interests.\n\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\n\nThe flexibility of this course allows students to either specialise in a specific professional area or to develop skills and knowledge in a range of scientific disciplines. All majors aim to produce professional scientists with a thorough grounding in theory and highly adaptable and practical scientific, experimental and computational skills relevant to the discipline chosen.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.",
