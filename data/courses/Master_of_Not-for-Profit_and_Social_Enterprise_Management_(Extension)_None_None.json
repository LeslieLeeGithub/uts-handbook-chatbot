In addition, high-level general management competencies needed to develop or manage complex organisations involved in the production of social good are developed.\n\nThe course has a strong focus on professional practice, including two innovative capstone subjects – Industry Research Project or Internship Experience – which allow you to work either on or with contemporary industry issues and opportunities.\n\nElective subject choices provide students an opportunity to shape their knowledge and skills profile to their career needs or aspirations. Course structures include a suggested list of elective options for students to assist their choice and to identify allied or complementary subjects to the not-for-profit and social enterprise fields.",
