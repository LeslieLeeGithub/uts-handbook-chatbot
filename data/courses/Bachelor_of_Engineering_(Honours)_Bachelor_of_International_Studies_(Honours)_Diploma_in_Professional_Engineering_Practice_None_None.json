  "overview": "This combined degree, offered jointly by UTS: Engineering and UTS: International Studies, links the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice (C09067) with the study of a language and culture other than English and the opportunity for students to study overseas for an academic year, pursuing a major research project in a field of their choice.\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic. Entry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nThe course allows students to complete the two qualifications of Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice and Bachelor of International Studies in six-and-a-half years of full-time study. On completion, students receive separate testamurs for each award.",
