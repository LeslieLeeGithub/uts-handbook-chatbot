  "overview": "UTS is a leading provider of postgraduate TESOL and Applied Linguistics courses, with academics who are published authors and internationally recognised experts in the field. This course meets the advanced professional development needs of a wide range of English language teachers in Australia and provides an internationally recognised qualification for teaching children, teenagers and adults, including higher education students. The course features flexible study options, with classes held at times suitable for students working standard full-time hours. Credit recognition may be available.\n\nThe course enables students to specialise in one of three streams. The first stream focuses on teaching English for academic purposes where graduates teach English to international students who are studying or seeking to study university courses in institutions where English is the medium of instruction; employers of these graduates are typically English language colleges or universities in Australia or overseas. The second stream is designed for teaching adults who are developing their English language, literacy and/ or numeracy skills as part of a migrant education and settlement program; a ‘second chance’ education program; a job-seeker, vocational or workplace program; or a community education program. Employers for graduates from this second stream include colleges in the vocational education and training sector, community education providers and industries. The third stream is for school teachers who work in Australia or overseas who teach English as an additional language and literacy to primary or secondary school students; graduates from this stream will typically be employed by schools.\n\nRead what our graduates say about our TESOL and Applied Linguistics courses\n\nDownload a TESOL and Applied Linguistics flyer",
