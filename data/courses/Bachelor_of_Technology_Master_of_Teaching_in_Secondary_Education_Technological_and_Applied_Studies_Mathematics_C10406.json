  "overview": "The Bachelor of Technology Master of Teaching in Secondary Education offers students the knowledge and practical hands-on experience required to teach over 12,000 school pupils studying Engineering and Technology Studies in NSW (NSW Education Standards Authority, 2021 HSC Enrolments by Course, 2021).\n\nThe combined \"Vertical Stack\" course (undergraduate + postgraduate degree) enables students to gain a greater depth of disciplinary knowledge in Engineering and Technology Studies before commencing teaching subjects in the Master of Teaching from their second year of study. Gaining a wider and deeper understanding in their field of study gives students more confidence when they commence teaching. They enter the classroom up to date on the most current developments in the discipline, and this is highly valued by schools.\n\nThe unique vertical structure of this combined course means students do not need to meet the standard three Band 5 HSC results, including English, for admission to an initial teacher education course.\n\nTo ensure that a high quality of teachers is maintained in the education sector, students will need to achieve a Credit average in the first two years of their university studies before progressing into their final years of the program.\n\nIf students do not meet the Credit average, they will still be able to continue in the Bachelor of Technology, and graduate with that qualification.\n\nStudents spend 80 days in one of more than 200 secondary schools across NSW. This practical experience with a trusted UTS partner school helps them gain the skills and confidence in curriculum and classroom management required for effective teaching in Engineering and Technology Studies, and also helps them develop personal and professional networks within and beyond education for their future career path.\n\nNot only are students accelerated in their career pathway to secondary teaching by achieving two qualifications, including one at postgraduate level, within the duration of a single undergraduate degree, they also have the benefits of a range of career options.",
