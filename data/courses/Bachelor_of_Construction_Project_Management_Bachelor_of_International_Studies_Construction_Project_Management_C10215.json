  "overview": "The Bachelor of Construction Project Management delivers the management, technology and process skills required to work in a variety of roles across the full spectrum of construction projects. Students are taught a wide range of project management methodologies with a strong focus on applying these to real-world projects.\n\nCombined with the Bachelor of International Studies, the course aims to provide graduates with the skills necessary for the management of all aspects of the construction process, as well as develop students' perspectives and understandings to enable them to meet the demands of an internationalised professional environment.\n\nThe emphasis on the utilisation of digital technologies, such as building information modelling, ensures that students understand the leading-edge advances being implemented in the industry. This knowledge can be applied in other industry sectors, providing even further employment opportunities.\n\nAll students are required to complete a minimum of 200 days' industry experience during the course, providing essential professional exposure. For the vast majority of students this entails paid employment in the industry with contractors and consultants (typically called cadetships). To broaden their personal and professional outlook, students can also choose electives, or a sub-major in a range of disciplines, outside construction project management, including business accounting, environmental studies and Aboriginal studies.",
