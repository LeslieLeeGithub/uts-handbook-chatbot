  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design (Honours) in Interior Architecture helps students to re-imagine interior environments and public spaces in local and global contexts. With a strong emphasis on people's experiences of space, this degree equips students with the critical skills required to interrogate and transgress the traditional boundaries of commercial interior design.\n\nThe course enhances employability through the development of a portfolio. The course allows students to develop skills in a specialised area, such as performative space, commercial interiors or residential interior design. Uniquely, digital technologies of representation, fabrication, internationalisation and design practice are emphasised.\n\nThe degree offers students a path from undergraduate through to postgraduate coursework and research study, including a PhD. Often the first step towards a research degree, an honours degree allows students to undertake self-determined, critical research and apply this to a specific project. Students prove their ability to develop and respond to a complex design brief, and develop innovative, holistic and professional design solutions.",
