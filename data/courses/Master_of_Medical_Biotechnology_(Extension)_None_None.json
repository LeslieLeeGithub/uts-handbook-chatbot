  "overview": "The Master of Medical Biotechnology (Extension) is for two distinct groups of students, namely the professional scientists wishing to update their industry-related skills for career advancement and students considering a research degree.\n\nThe compulsory core subjects are relevant to all science disciplines and provide a backbone of skills important to a professional scientist; be they engaged in research, science businesses, industries or government organisations. These are the skills of communication, critical analysis, project management and innovation and commercialisation. These are complemented by professional stream choices which enable students to select a portfolio of skills relevant to their chosen career. The professional strand is complemented by medical biotechnology study. Students may have the option of undertaking a small research project, subject to approval by the faculty. For students with suitable achievement levels, an opportunity to undertake a more substantial research project is available by transferring into the Master of Philosophy in Medical Biotechnology (C04389). For those considering a research degree, the Master of Philosophy in Medical Biotechnology provides a pathway to a PhD.",
