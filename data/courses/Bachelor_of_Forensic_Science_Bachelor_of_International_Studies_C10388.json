  "overview": "The Bachelor of Forensic Science Bachelor of International Studies prepares students for professional and specialist work in the discipline of forensic science. Students build a solid foundation of skills and knowledge in the enabling sciences, complemented by an in-depth understanding of forensic science in the context of their chosen discipline. Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills is a focus of the degree, with graduates in high demand from a diverse range of industries and organisations.\n\nIn the International Studies component, students select one of six languages (Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, or Spanish) and one of the following three pathways: Language, Culture & the Professional World, Language; Culture & Global Exchange; and International Honours.\n\nThis course provides students with a thorough understanding of how forensic science can solve and prevent crime. This is a hands-on course using world-class facilities that are modelled on operational laboratories. The course is well regarded nationally and internationally, with strong links to industries such as the federal and state police services, national and international forensic institutions, and government laboratories.\n\nInternational study is unique allowing students to gain qualifications in language and cultural awareness for a country of their choice. This added dimension expands students’ career opportunities and employability in the global workplace.",
