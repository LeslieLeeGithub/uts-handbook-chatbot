  "overview": "The course offers a practice-based approach to learning through the integration of digital and analogue technologies across the broad field of integrated product design, as well as the potential for specialisation within highly contemporary and innovative integrated product design practices.\n\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\n\nProduct design expands on the traditional field of industrial design to reflect the changing realities of the globalised design profession. With a strong emphasis on creativity and technology, the course equips students with the capacity to form an integrated approach and understanding of how to conceptualise, visualise and realise products, services and/or systems as a design professional. The program offers students the option to pursue a sub-major in interaction design.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.",
