  "overview": "For those with an interest in different forms of creative writing and publishing, this practice-based course provides the skills and industry knowledge to work in the field. The Bachelor of Communication (Writing and Publishing) at UTS is an industry-led course, designed and taught by a team of award-winning published authors, editors, scholars and industry professionals. Writing and Publishing builds students’ knowledge of Australian and global publishing contexts, as well as writing and storytelling across an array of formats, like fiction and nonfiction, screenwriting, digital content and games. Students also develop strengths in critical thinking, research, editing and publishing and storytelling in broader contexts – all skills transferable to a wide range of industries and careers.\n\nThis degree combines a professional degree with language and culture studies, enhancing professional training and career options by providing students with the opportunity to undertake studies at an overseas University.\n\nTo hone their skills, students engage in interactive classes led by skilled practitioners. Subjects often rely on workshopping, with students learning key concepts, applying these to their own writing, and collaborating with other students to provide and receive feedback. In this way the course provides students with a brilliant opportunity to be a part of a unique writer’s studio and develop their craft, finishing with a folio of works covering key forms and genres.",
