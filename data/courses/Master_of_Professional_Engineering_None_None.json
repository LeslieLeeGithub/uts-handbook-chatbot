  "overview": "This course provides an opportunity at master's level for technical specialists and professional engineers who have completed either a three-year Bachelor of Technology or a four-year Bachelor of Engineering to graduate with an Engineers Australia-accredited, professional engineering qualification. The course enables students to deepen knowledge and expertise in their field of specialisation to be ready to practise in engineering.\n\nThe Master of Professional Engineering is designed to incorporate an integrated approach to professional engineering practice through professional engineering subjects, major-specific subjects, an independent project, and engineering practice stream.\n\nStudents who have completed a Bachelor of Engineering that is accredited by Engineers Australia should apply for the Master of Engineering (C04271) or Master of Engineering (Extension) (C04277).\n\nThis course allows students to choose a program of study that not only helps to deepen the body of knowledge acquired in their first degree, but also gives them an opportunity to embark on a 12-week professional experience or equivalent (as required by Engineers Australia). It also provides a unique opportunity to deepen their knowledge and gain practical skills by undertaking an independent engineering graduate project in their chosen major.",
