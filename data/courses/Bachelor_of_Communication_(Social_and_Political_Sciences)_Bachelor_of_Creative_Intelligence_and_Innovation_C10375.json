  "overview": "The Bachelor of Communication (Social and Political Sciences) at UTS is designed for those passionate about influencing key areas of public policy like climate change, human rights or issues facing Indigenous Australians and migrants. In the course, students explore current social issues, investigate society and analyse the implications of change in Australian and global communities. In this practice-led course, students work with experienced practitioners to develop their skills as researchers, analysts, critical thinkers, effective communicators and advocates, and bring key policy issues to life with their interpersonal and public communication skills.\n\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\n\nThe Bachelor of Communication (Social and Political Sciences) will provide students with a theoretical framework rooted in historical and philosophical perspectives on how societies function, bolstering this with applied learning in qualitative and quantitative research methods. Students learn how to tackle key social issues and make a real difference through research and communication, contributing to new and ongoing debates. They graduate with a multifaceted skillset to bring to diverse organisations striving for social change.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.",
