  "overview": "This course provides an opportunity at master's level for professional engineers to extend in depth and breadth the knowledge and skills gained in their undergraduate studies. The course is an extension of the traditional Master of Engineering (C04271) in that it also includes a sub-major in one of the fields offered as majors.\n\nThe course follows an integrated approach to professional practice through professional engineering subjects, subjects relating to the major and sub-major, an independent project in at least one field of engineering, and a set of electives. Students who wish to undertake a more substantial research project have the opportunity to transfer to the Master of Engineering (Advanced) (C04278).\n\nThis course allows students to choose a program of study that deepens the body of knowledge acquired in their first degree as well as expands knowledge boundaries into policy and engineering management areas. It also provides an opportunity to broaden knowledge in another field through a sub-major, giving an added advantage to students who seek career options in multidisciplinary areas.",
