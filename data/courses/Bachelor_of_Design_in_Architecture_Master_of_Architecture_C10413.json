  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Architecture is the first of two degrees needed to become an architect. Students wishing to qualify for professional recognition as architects must also complete the Master of Architecture program.\n\nThis course is an innovative and flexible professional degree. Through a non-sequential structure, which allows students to select from a range of core and elective subjects, it gives students choice regarding their professional specialisation that can best serve them in their future careers. Architectural design subjects enhance a critical understanding of architecture as both a discipline with an existing body of knowledge and a set of practices that continuously challenge and add to that body of knowledge.\n\nArchitectural practice subjects prepare students for expanded practice in emerging media and markets, contemporary business practice and global economies and within challenging social, environmental, political and regulatory contexts. Students who complete a Master of Architecture degree and subsequent practical experience are eligible to become registered architects.",
