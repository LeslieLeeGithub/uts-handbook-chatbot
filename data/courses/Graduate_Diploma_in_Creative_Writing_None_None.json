  "overview": "The Graduate Diploma in Creative Writing is part of an articulated program designed to meet a range of needs for those who want to start a career in writing or apply their communication skills to fiction, young-adult and/or speculative fiction, creative non-fiction and screenwriting. It is also for experienced writers who want to develop and enhance their practical writing skills as well as their ability to critically reflect on their practice.\n\nBuilding a portfolio and pitching one's work are key components of our Graduate Diploma in Creative Writing. Students publish widely and regularly in local, national and international literary journals and magazines, and lead the annual UTS Writers' Anthology, which celebrates its 35th anniversary in 2021.\n\nThe Graduate Diploma in Creative Writing is a good starting point for early career writers who want to develop craft skills in a range of genres and forms, and who may later develop a major project through the articulated Master of Arts in Creative Writing.\n\nDownload the Creative Writing flyer",
