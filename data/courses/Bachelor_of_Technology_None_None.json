  "overview": "This course is a technology degree which allows students to develop broad based engineering skills similar in nature to the Bachelor of Engineering Science (C10066) degree but without full engineering technologist status.\n\nThe course provides students with the skills required at an engineering technologist level – and hence the ability to work with professional engineers – without developing full professional engineering competencies.\n\nIt is intended for students who require a broad overview of STEM knowledge via the \"Flexible Engineering\" or \"Engineering and Technology Studies\" majors; and to specialise in a field of technology, for example, students with prior vocational qualifications may choose the Advanced Manufacturing major to learn the latest industry 4.0 manufacturing technologies, without meeting the requirement for Engineering Australia professional accreditation.",
