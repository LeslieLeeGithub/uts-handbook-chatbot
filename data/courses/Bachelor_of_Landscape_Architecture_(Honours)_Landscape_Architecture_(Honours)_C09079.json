  "overview": "The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (Honours) is a four-year honours degree designed to develop skills in design, construction and management associated with natural and built landscapes.\n\nThis degree is for those who are passionate about sustainability, ecology, urban environments and design.\n\nStudents develop the skills to creatively address the key challenges of contemporary society, including climate change, urban densification and the loss of biodiversity.\n\nTheory combined with hands-on studio projects is key to this course. Students learn how landscape and public space can unify complex urban environments, balancing environmental needs with those of contemporary society and culture. Students apply this knowledge in studios where they develop the skills to create cohesive, practical and resilient design solutions that combine both art and science.\n\nThe degree has an international focus, exploring global and regional cities and urban environments through case studies, design research, technical analysis and global study tours.\n\nThe honours program allows students to work at a higher level of academic study in a relevant area of interest. UTS offers graduates the opportunity to apply to the Master of Landscape Architecture (C04270).",
