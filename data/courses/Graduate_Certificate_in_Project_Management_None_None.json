The UTS Graduate Certificate in Project Management equips students with foundational knowledge and experience to launch or enhance project management careers across all industries – such as banking and finance, construction and engineering, event management, government, health and information technology.\n\nGraduates of the Graduate Certificate in Project Management who wish to extend their studies will gain full credit for the Graduate Certificate subjects when they enrol in the Master of Project Management.\n\nTo cater for busy work schedules, UTS delivers most of the postgraduate project management subjects in intensive block workshops. These workshops create an immersive experience where students work with their peers in a team-based, simulated project environment.\n\nUTS academics are at the forefront of international project management research. This breadth of knowledge ensures that students have access to leading-edge thinking applied in both project-specific and organisational contexts. Our teaching staff and specialist guest lecturers have extensive industry experience and knowledge of current trends in project management practice.",
