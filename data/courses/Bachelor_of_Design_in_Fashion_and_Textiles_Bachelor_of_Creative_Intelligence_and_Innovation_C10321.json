  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Fashion and Textiles has been designed to enable students to create pathways of learning as they progress through the degree with a flexible and diverse approach to learning. Emphasis throughout this practice-based course is placed on value, innovation, creativity and responsible practice. Students should develop flexibility and confidence in working across the diverse environments that constitute contemporary practice.\n\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\n\nThe course centres on design studios which integrate practice-oriented learning about specific fashion and textile projects, and parallels the process that professionals undertake in industry. There is strong emphasis on creativity, experimentation and future thinking in the fashion industry. Professional practice is embedded in all fashion studios and builds on contemporary industry practice with a focus on international fashion markets. Projects are developed through individual and group work, and are often tied to external projects with industry or cultural partners.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.",
