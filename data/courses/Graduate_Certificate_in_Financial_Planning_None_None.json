The certificate addresses many of the dimensions of the professional profile of modern financial planners.\n\nThe course has been designed to suit the needs of professionals who currently work full time: most subjects are delivered in a mix of online learning and face-to-face interaction over two weekends. The block mode structure means that students can cover the content and complete the assessments for most subjects in a six-week period. This combines the convenience of online learning with the rich experience of class interaction with a group of highly motivated and engaged peers.",
