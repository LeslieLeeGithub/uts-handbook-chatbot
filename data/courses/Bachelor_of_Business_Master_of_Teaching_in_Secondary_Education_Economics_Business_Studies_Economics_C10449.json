  "overview": "The Bachelor of Business Master of Teaching in Secondary Education offers students the knowledge and practical hands-on experience required to teach over 18,000 secondary school pupils studying Business Studies and over 5000 pupils undertaking Economics in NSW (NSW Education Standards Authority, 2021 HSC Enrolments by Course, 2021).\n\nThe combined \"Vertical Stack\" course (undergraduate + postgraduate degree) enables students to gain a greater depth of disciplinary knowledge in Economics before they commence their teaching subjects in the Master of Teaching from the second year of study. Gaining a wider and deeper understanding in the field of study gives students more confidence when they commence as a teacher. Students enter the classroom up to date on the most current developments in the discipline, and this is highly valued by schools.\n\nThe unique vertical structure of this combined course means students do not need to meet the standard three Band 5 HSC results, including English, for admission to an initial teacher education course.\n\nTo ensure high quality teachers in the education sector, students need to achieve a Credit average in the first two years of their university studies before progressing into the final years of the program.\n\nIf students do not meet this Credit average, they are still able to continue in the Bachelor of Business and graduate with that qualification.\n\nStudents spend 80 days in one of 200+ Secondary Schools across NSW. This practical experience with a trusted UTS partner school helps students gain the skills and confidence in curriculum and classroom management required for effective teaching in Business and Economics, and also helps them develop personal and professional networks within and beyond education for their future career path.\n\nNot only are students accelerated in their career pathway to secondary teaching by achieving two qualifications, including one at postgraduate level, within the duration of a single undergraduate degree, they will have the benefits of a range of career options.",
