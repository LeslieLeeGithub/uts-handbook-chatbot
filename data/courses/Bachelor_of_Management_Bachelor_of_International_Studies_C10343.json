  "overview": "The combined degree, Bachelor of Management Bachelor of International Studies, is offered jointly by Business and International Studies. The program integrates the study of business management alongside the culture and language of another country. Students select one of four majors within the Bachelor of Management – Events, Sport Business and Digital Creative – each of which represent a core sector of the entertainment and experience industries. The International Studies component of the combined degree allows students to develop sector-specific knowledge and skills in both Australian settings and abroad.\n\nThis combined degree enables students to travel and study abroad for up to two semesters, located with one of UTS’s partner universities. It is therefore distinctive in offering both tertiary education and life experience in two countries. The course develops deep knowledge of the entertainment and experience industries while combining direct exposure to their application in different cultures and economies.",
