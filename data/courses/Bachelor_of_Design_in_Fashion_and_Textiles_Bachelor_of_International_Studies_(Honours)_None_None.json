  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Fashion and Textiles Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Design in Fashion and Textiles Bachelor of International Studies (C10307).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nWhile UTS recognises that a commercial framework is important, students are encouraged to become industry leaders through a focus on innovation, experimentation, individual expression and the future of fashion. They have full access to world-class textile and fashion workshops, working under the close supervision of expert staff. This experimental spirit is balanced by close industry ties. Students get the opportunity to work on real-world projects with brands such as Jets Swimwear, Think Positive, Australian Wool Innovation, Calcoup Knitwear and Swarovski.\n\nUTS also understands that the fashion industry is as much about people as it is about garments: using studios and interdisciplinary subjects, students gain the communication and teamwork skills to develop, articulate and sell their creations to peers and industry. Graduates are recognised globally and many have gone on to work or study overseas, including fashion capitals London, New York, Tokyo and Milan. Leading international designers employing UTS graduates include Alexander McQueen, Kenzo, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Helmut Lang.\n\nThe international experience of the international studies component further enhances career prospects.",
