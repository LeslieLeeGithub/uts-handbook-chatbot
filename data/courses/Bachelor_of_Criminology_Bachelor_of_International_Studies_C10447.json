  "overview": "The Bachelor of Criminology Bachelor of International Studies prepares students to respond to the changing nature of crime in the 21st century by addressing the realities of crime in an increasingly digital and transnational age. Ideal for those starting their careers or extending their learning to respond to industry needs, students specialise in either digital forensics & security, data analytics & research, justice & legal studies, or forensics and complement this with studies of a language other than English, intercultural communication and practical cultural experience to engage with diverse populations in a professional context.\n\nThe mix of theory and practice in core subjects, in the curated majors and via possible combined degrees with Forensic Science and International Studies addresses industry needs for an applied approach to criminology and the increasingly digital and transnational dimensions of crime.\n\nThe course is offered primarily on campus, but individual subjects include aspects of asynchronous self-paced learning, synchronous online activities, collaborative learning and activities on campus, and industry engagement via site visits and/or guest speakers.",
