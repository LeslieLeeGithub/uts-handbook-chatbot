  "overview": "Bachelor of Mathematical Sciences Bachelor of International Studies is an exciting combined degree in mathematical sciences, language and cultures. It enables students with a strong interest in mathematics, statistics, and data to grow and develop skills that are in high demand in the modern work force. The basis is a comprehensive foundation of core mathematical competencies, combined with one of four majors, ensuring graduates have the knowledge and skills to develop and adapt in the rapidly changing work environment.\n\nMathematical sciences focuses on the application of mathematical techniques to real-world problems.\n\nIn the International Studies, students select one of six languages (Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, or Spanish) and one of the following three pathways: Language, Culture & the Professional World, Language; Culture & Global Exchange; and International Honours.\n\nThe core provides a broad mathematical foundation, while each major provides depth of study. International studies is unique, allowing students to gain qualifications in language and cultural awareness relating to a country of their choice. This added dimension expands students’ career opportunities and employability in the global workplace.",
