  "overview": "For those who have a passion for visual arts, drawing and storytelling, the Bachelor of Animation Production at UTS gives students the knowledge and hands-on experience required to create animation work that communicates clear and powerful ideas, helping them stand out in a global industry.\n\nThe Bachelor of Animation Production students learn how to observe the world around them, drawing directly from life to gain inspiration for characters and stories. They discover how to think creatively and develop ideas through multiple stages, focusing upon character development, narrative structure and engaging performance. They also learn fundamental 2D, 3D and hybrid animation skills to bring their stories to life.\n\nThis degree combines a professional degree with language and culture studies, enhancing professional training and career options by providing students with the opportunity to undertake studies at an overseas University.\n\nGraduates from the Bachelor of Animation Production are image-makers, critical thinkers and storytellers in equal measure and we help equip them to become leaders in this industry. Students will learn to develop, pitch and defend ideas, and ultimately create original content for film, TV, advertising and other screen-based media that will engage global audiences.\n\nOne of the benefits of studying our Bachelor of Animation Production is the link to UTS’s existing industry connections that help give students that competitive advantage. Students have the opportunity to work with live projects and active partners, such as ABC Podcasts, VIVID, the Australia Piano Quartet, and other collaborations with international universities at the Annecy MIFA campus etc. UTS also has long-standing relationships with Sydney's local animation studios such as Flying Bark Productions, Mighty Nice, Cheeky Little Media, Dave Enterprises, and Animal Logic which offer students multiple opportunities to engage in practice while studying.\n\nUTS understands that teamwork is at the heart of the animation industry which is why a studio-led approach is used to create a high-intensity practical environment where students learn how to work with their peers in a professional and collaborative atmosphere, melding creativity, technology and research.",
