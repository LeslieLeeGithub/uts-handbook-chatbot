  "overview": "This course is an exit degree for the Bachelor of Nursing. It is run by the School of Nursing and Midwifery in the Faculty of Health. It is intended for students who have completed at least 2 years study in the Bachelor of Nursing program (standard) and who are unable to progress in the clinical component of their studies due to extenuating circumstances, for example ill health. Students study 2 years of the Bachelor of Nursing program. Their final year includes the 3rd year nursing theory subjects and electives from the Bachelor of Health Science program. They complete the requisite number of subjects to reach 144 credit points.\n\nThis course is an exit degree for the Bachelor of Nursing. It presents an opportunity for students who are unable to progress with the clinical component of their studies to complete an undergraduate qualification. Traditionally students who are unable to progress would look to transfer to another course, however given the unique structure of the Bachelor of Nursing there is limited opportunity for recognition of prior learning. The Bachelor of Health Care option means that the student complete an undergraduate qualification in a shorter period of time at a reduced cost. Enrolment in this course is by invitation only. It is not available for direct entry or transfer.",
