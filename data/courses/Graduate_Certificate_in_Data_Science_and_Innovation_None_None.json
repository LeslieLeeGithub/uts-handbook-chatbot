  "overview": "The Graduate Certificate in Data Science and Innovation is designed for students to gain data science skills in a fast-paced mode. It has a flexible and comprehensive course structure with a group of fundamental and advanced subjects. This allows people with different backgrounds and learning objectives to take the course either as a fast-track pathway into the data science industry, or to develop specialised skills to further enhance their data science career.\n\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, the course integrates fundamental theories with industry experiences, real-world projects and self-directed study, equipping graduates with an understanding of the potential of analytics to transform practice. The course is delivered in a range of modes, including contemporary online and face-to-face learning experiences in UTS's leading-edge facilities.\n\nUpon successful completion of the graduate certificate, students can also choose to progress to the Graduate Diploma in Data Science and Innovation (C60124) or Master of Data Science and Innovation (C04372), a world-leading program of study in analytics and data science.\n\nThe dramatic growth of data in every conceivable industry, from oceanography to market research, presents another major driving force in generating unprecedented global demand for data science skills.",
