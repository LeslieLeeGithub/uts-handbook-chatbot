  "overview": "This degree may be awarded to candidates who have completed an individual program of supervised work and submitted a thesis embodying the results. Topics which involve close cooperation with industry are strongly encouraged, and a majority of current candidates are engaged in topics which are actively supported by their employers.\n\nThis degree provides practising engineers with an opportunity to pursue, in depth, the solution of an engineering problem which requires individual effort beyond the scope of a bachelor's degree. In keeping with the faculty's overall policies, the accent is on applied research and development work, although basic research proposals are also welcomed and supported.",
