  "overview": "Bachelor of Communication (Journalism) Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Communication (Journalism) Bachelor of International Studies (C10365).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nSituated in the heart of Sydney, in close proximity to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the Bachelor of Communication (Journalism) at UTS is a practice-based course, providing students with opportunities to engage with real reporting through UTS Central News and industry leaders like the ABC, The Guardian and more. Our Bachelor of Communication (Journalism) gives students a crucial understanding of the role journalists play in a democracy, with journalism providing a forum for public debate and giving voice to all communities. Through hands-on practice, students will also gain the skills in production, digital content creation, news reporting and analysis and writing required to excel in this diverse industry. Students can apply these skills in various media platforms, including online, audio, television, video, print and social media.",
