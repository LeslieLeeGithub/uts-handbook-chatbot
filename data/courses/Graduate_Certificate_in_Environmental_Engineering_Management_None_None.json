  "overview": "This course deals with the broad aspects of environmental management relevant to practising professionals in engineering science, planning, architecture, law, surveying, health and building. Engineers, scientists, town planners and other professionals working in this field have a compelling duty to ensure that the adverse effects of development on the total environment are minimised. The subjects offered in this course follow an integrated approach to professional practice through a choice of compulsory subjects in professional engineering, environmental engineering management and an elective.\n\nEnvironmental engineering and management is high on the political agenda. It also has a high professional priority. Students develop a background and competence in environmental management. This course is ideal for practising professionals who are interested in environmental management issues but who do not have the time to commit to a master's course.",
