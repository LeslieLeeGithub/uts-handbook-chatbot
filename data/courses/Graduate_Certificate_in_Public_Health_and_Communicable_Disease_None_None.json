Rather than working with individual patients, public health professionals are focused on enhancing health outcomes and improving health care solutions on a population level in developing and developed countries. A postgraduate public health degree is recognised worldwide as being invaluable for a career in public health. Students study the public health approach to enhancing health, public health research methods, including epidemiology and biostatistics, and the control of communicable diseases. Delivered in a flexible and convenient way, students learn online. Course content is based on contemporary research and has been developed in close consultation with industry. The curriculum comprises subjects that provide a solid grounding of knowledge and skills required in any public health career. Students learn and are supported by academic staff who are highly experienced experts and researchers, recognised as leaders in their chosen fields of public health.\n\nWith a career in public health, students can drive meaningful change that impacts large numbers of people. That’s because public health is focused on population-level outcomes. This course is open to individuals who are seeking a career in public health research or practice. The course gives students skills in public health programs in a wide range of areas, such as communicable diseases, epidemiology and biostatistics, and Indigenous health.",
