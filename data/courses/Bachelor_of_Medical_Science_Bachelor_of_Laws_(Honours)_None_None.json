  "overview": "Laws are of special importance in many areas of medical science, including medical and health practice, medical and biological research, and industrial and commercial enterprise. The Bachelor of Medical Science Bachelor of Laws (Honours) is offered jointly by UTS Law and UTS Science. Honours relates to the law component only and students must successfully complete both of the research subjects: 76090 Research Methodology and 76040 Research Thesis. Strong research skills are valued highly in contemporary professional practice.\n\nMedical Scientists with Law training have careers that are dynamic and involve an exciting range of professions from research and development, policy and practice in the medical and Health and Sciences, government, industrial and commercial applications of medical science and law. Medical Scientists at UTS can chose to major in Medical and Health-related Sciences or Pathology, allowing them to have a speciality relevant to their career choices and interests. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students also learn how to identify infectious agents and the latest approaches to prevent, treat infections and limit their impact on society. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation.\n\nThe program provides full-time study for students wishing to obtain a professional legal qualification that satisfies the academic requirements only for admission as a lawyer together with specialisation in medical science.\n\nThe course addresses the increasing need for medical science expertise among lawyers. Graduates develop critical and analytical skills inherent to an understanding of the complex links between medical science and the law, thus increasing their employment opportunities and career choices. Students have the opportunity to engage in deeper study of the law by studying 76090 Research Methodology and undertaking 76040 Research Thesis. This course can be a pathway to higher degree research programs.",

  "course_structure": "The course comprises a total of 240 credit points and allows students to graduate with the separate degrees of Bachelor of Medical Science (BMedSc) and Bachelor of Laws (LLB). The study components for course completion are as follows.\n\nThe law component of 144 credit points is made up of:\n\nThe medical science component comprises 96 credit points of core medical science subjects.\n\nStudents graduate from the BMedSc independently from the LLB. However, to be eligible for graduation from the BMedSc, students must complete a total of 96 credit points of science subjects plus at least 96 credit points of Bachelor of Laws subjects.\n\nGraduation from the medical science component of the combined degree is not possible prior to completion of all components of the combined degree. Students wishing to graduate with a Bachelor of Medical Science prior to completion of the law component of the combined degree must apply for transfer to the Bachelor of Medical Science (C10184) single degree program where they must complete all requirements for the stand-alone single degree version.\n\nSimilarly, a student can graduate from the law component of the combined degree prior to completion of the medical science component, but if they wish to continue with the medical science component, they must apply for transfer to the Bachelor of Medical Science (C10184) single degree program where they need to complete all requirements for the stand-alone single degree version.\n\nFor a current listing of subjects in each course refer to the study package directory.",
