  "overview": "Strategic communicators are responsible for a range of public-facing communication initiatives, such as digital, traditional and social media and marketing campaign design and production, advertising, media liaison or the development and implementation of large-scale communication strategies. As such, a fundamental understanding of the law as it relates to public engagement is a valuable tool for professionals in this field.\n\nThis degree enables students to explore strategic communication processes and industries – such as advertising and public relations – in their social, economic and political contexts. Course content emphasises specialist skills in communication campaign design and production, as well as an in-depth exploration of legal theory and practice that meets the academic requirements for admission to practise law in NSW.\n\nUsing their elective choices, students can build specialist expertise in areas such as media, entertainment and contract law. They can also choose to study the Legal Futures and Technology major as a way of gaining first-hand experience of the technologies shaping the future of legal work.",
