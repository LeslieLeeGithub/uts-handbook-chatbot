Using industry-based production models, this course allows students to experience and specialise in a variety of roles such as cinematography, scriptwriting, directing, producing, sound, editing, and more. UTS student productions have been screened internationally, won awards at film festivals, and have been developed further into series.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate a rapidly changing world.",
