  "career_options": "Global career opportunities for Honours graduates in product design, fashion & textile design, visual communication, creative industries and social, service and strategic design are expanding. Professional designers are now employed well beyond the creative industries, for example to bring design thinking to business and community sectors and to lead design projects. UTS Design Honours graduates are highly sought after in existing and emergent fields. Honours graduates develop disciplinary expertise while also possessing skills to practice beyond their specific discipline and contribute to broader outcomes. Honours graduates know how to work independently and thrive in teams and are equipped with the high-level communication and advocacy skills to become writers, researchers, editors, and critics.\n\nIn fashion & textile design, global career opportunities for Honours graduates include fashion designer, textile designer, pattern cutter, art/creative director, print designer and work in fashion production and fashion forecasting. Some graduates start their own fashion design business, while others work within an established company locally or with international brands.\n\nGraduates specialising in product design enjoy careers as in-house product designers in a manufacturing company or working as a design consultant. Graduates work in emerging fields such as service and strategic design or digital interaction design, adapting advanced technologies for new experiences and networked environments. Integrated education also allows graduates to move beyond design to managing production, distribution and the marketing of new products. Honours also prepares graduates for further study in specialised fields such as transport design or associated professional disciplines.\n\nAs a critical discipline in today’s complex information rich world, graduates specialising in visual communication and photography experiment with emerging and traditional technologies to expand how text and image (whether data-driven, generative, moving or still) can provide new frameworks for social and cultural change. Incorporating a wide range of practices, graduates work in information visualisation, interaction design, motion design, photographic practice and photographic studios, publishing, web media, wayfinding, creative code, machine learning, 3D technologies such as augmented reality and virtual reality, as well as service and strategy design.\n\nHonours graduates also continue to study at the postgraduate level in both coursework or research degrees, as well as qualify for prestigious postgraduate scholarships.",
