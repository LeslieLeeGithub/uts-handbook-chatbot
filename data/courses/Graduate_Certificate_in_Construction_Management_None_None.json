  "overview": "Construction management is one of the most rapidly expanding sectors of specialisation in Australia. Construction management specialists have very good job prospects in both construction and infrastructure work areas. The particular mix of skills offered in this degree combine traditional project management frameworks along with specialised preparation in technological advancements and human factors that are a requirement for successful managers in the construction industry.\n\nThe course aims to provide graduates with management skills relevant to the operation of construction projects. The course utilises concepts associated with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK®) as applied in the construction context. Key areas of construction management are covered in the course including: construction technology and regulations; time, cost and quality management; risk; professional ethics; and industrial relations. Student learning establishes underpinning construction management theory that is strongly supported by best practice case studies delivered by leading academics and practitioners, giving students access to relevant, real-world expertise that reflects the realities of today's construction sector. Through the use of digital technologies students receive hands-on experience with real-world estimating, programming and building information modelling (BIM) platforms.",
