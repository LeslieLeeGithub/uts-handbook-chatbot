  "overview": "The Graduate Diploma in Planning provides a new career path for design, planning and property professionals, equipping graduates with a broad understanding of planning issues alongside the negotiation skills and creative thinking required to resolve them.\n\nWhereas planning has often been seen as an approval process, UTS approaches the discipline as a critical task, one that connects communities with governments, institutions and developers.\n\nProperty development and planning students study a common first year, which develops a mutual understanding of how to balance private and public interests in urban development.",
