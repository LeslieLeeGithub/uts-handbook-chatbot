  "overview": "The Bachelor of Property Economics Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Property Economics Bachelor of International Studies (C10320).\n\nFor students thinking about a career in business, economics or property, the Bachelor of Property Economics provides the edge required to get started in a global industry.\n\nThe combined degree provides students specialising in property economics with additional practical skills by providing the opportunity to acquire knowledge and understanding of a language other than English and another culture.\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nIn this degree students learn the specialist knowledge required to enter the property sector, with skills in property valuation, market analysis, investment and development. Their skill set is just as relevant locally as it is internationally.\n\nThis degree covers economic, legal and financial disciplines, giving students the flexibility to pursue a variety of career paths. This business knowledge is also transferable, providing options for a transition to other sectors as careers develop.\n\nUTS graduates are highly sought after and have excellent starting salaries: the property industry actively recruits property economics students. Most students are working within the industry by their third year of study.\n\nThis job-readiness results from UTS's industry connections: the curriculum was developed in consultation with industry, guest lecturers come from industry, and students work with real-world projects such as Barangaroo, Central Park and Green Square.\n\nThe degree structures classes so that students do a mixture of individual and team-based work mixing theory and practice. This means graduates seamlessly fit into team-based, workplace environments.\n\nA further two years of study introduce and consolidate the learning of a language and culture other than English.",
