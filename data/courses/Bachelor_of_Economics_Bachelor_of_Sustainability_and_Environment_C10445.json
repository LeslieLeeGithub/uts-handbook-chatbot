  "overview": "The Bachelor of Economics Bachelor of Sustainability and Environment offers students the analytical and quantitative skills required for an in-depth understanding of key economic principles and the multidisciplinary knowledge of sustainability required to operate within the green economy.\n\nSubjects in the Bachelor of Economics provide training in econometrics, macroeconomics, microeconomics as well as other Economics fields with an emphasis on practical policy. Students gain skills to understand the economic efficiency and conditions for market failure that necessitate government intervention and are equipped with economic and econometric policy analysis skills suitable for tackling economic and social issues related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Subjects in the Bachelor of Sustainability and Environment expand this study to the complexity of sustainability in the environmental, political, social, and cultural senses. It also provides depth of study on and practical engagement with different industry and professional applications of sustainability.\n\nThe course promotes an understanding of how institutional rules and incentives shape economic outcomes and provides knowledge of the economic, environmental, social and cultural sustainability through Economics and Sustainability specialisations, internship-like experiences and problem-based learning within the Economics and Sustainability and Environment subjects.",
