  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Product Design prepares students for a career in the global product design industry. Students learn how to tackle complex problem solving, explore creative solutions, and develop realistic outcomes that could make a mark on the world.\n\nUTS believes a hands-on approach is fundamental for every aspiring designer. As such, the student's starting point is the individual design and making of an object. Throughout their studies students learn how to design, prototype and test design solutions, drawing on cutting-edge technologies and approaches, such as UX (user experience), wearables and electronics and gain hands-on experience in the faculty's digital and fabrication workshops.\n\nAlongside a strong technical base, the degree applies the creative problem-solving required to design experiences that make a difference to everyday life, whether in developing economies or digital cultures. Central to this approach is an understanding of the relationships between objects, culture, economy, technology, business and human behaviour.",
