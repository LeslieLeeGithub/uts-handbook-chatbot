  "overview": "This course is a comprehensive preparation for careers in the professional practice of engineering. Students learn to deal with complex systems and manage large-scale projects using the most appropriate emerging technologies.\n\nTaking a transdisciplinary approach, Creative Intelligence and Innovation utilises multiple perspectives from diverse fields, integrating a range of industry experiences, real-world projects and self-initiated proposals, equipping graduates to address the wicked problems, complex challenges and untapped opportunities in today's world.\n\nThis course adopts a practice-based approach to engineering education and the course content is a mix of theory and practice. As well as gaining strong technical skills in engineering, students gain skills in business analysis, problem-solving, teamwork and communication. Employers look for graduates with industry experience and, in this course, students are exposed to real engineering problems in their coursework as well as completing 12 weeks' work experience. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong.\n\nBy focusing on the high-level conceptual thinking and problem-solving practices that lead to the development of innovative, creative and entrepreneurial outcomes, students of the combined degree also gain leading edge capabilities that are highly valued in the globalised world, including dealing with critical and creative thinking, invention, complexity, innovation, future scenario building and entrepreneurship, and the ability to work on their own across disciplines. These creative intelligence competencies enable graduates to navigate in a rapidly changing world.",

The questionnaire allows applicants to demonstrate their strong motivation to study engineering or IT at UTS and may assist applicants whose ATAR falls short of the required cut-off by up to three points.\n\nNon-current school leavers are advised to complete the employment question on their UAC application as adjustment factors may be applied on the basis of relevant work experience.\n\nThe English proficiency requirement for international students or local applicants with international qualifications is: Academic IELTS: 6.5 overall with a writing score of 6.0; or TOEFL: paper based: 550-583 overall with TWE of 4.5, internet based: 79-93 overall with a writing score of 21; or AE5: Pass; or PTE: 58-64 with a writing score of 50; or C1A/C2P: 176-184 with a writing score of 169.\n\nEligibility for admission does not guarantee offer of a place.\n\n; Admission requirements for Australian students (ATAR): 75; Admission requirements for Chinese students (Gaokao score out of 750): 471; Admission requirements for students with GCE A Levels: 8; Admission requirements for Hong Kong students (HKDSE): 15; Admission requirements for Indian students (AISSC): 11; Admission requirements for Indian students (ISC): 80; Admission requirements for students with IB or Predicted IB: 25/30 ; Admission requirements for Malaysian students (STPM with 3 AL Subjects): 8; Admission requirements for Singaporean students (A Level): 8; Admission requirements for USA students (SAT 1): 1120; Admission requirements for UTS Foundation Studies students: 6.6",
  "career_options": "Career options depend on the major chosen.\n\nBy being creative thinkers, initiators of new ideas, scenario planners, global strategists, open network designers or sustainable futures innovators within their chosen field of study, graduates maximise the potential of their chosen profession, making them highly sought after graduates with the ability to identify and develop solutions to some of the most complex issues that face their disciplines and society.",
  "course_structure": "Students are required to complete 270 credit points, comprising 174 credit points in engineering and 96 credit points in creative intelligence and innovation. The engineering component consists of core (48 credit points), major (field of practice) (120 credit points) and professional engineering practice (6 credit points).\n\nThe engineering major is selected at the time of admission; however, it is possible to apply to change major at a later date. Students selecting the flexible major should decide by the end of the first year of full-time study whether to transfer to a designated major or continue with the flexible program.\n\nThe creative intelligence and innovation subjects are undertaken in accelerated form within July and Summer sessions during the first three years of study, and through one full year of study after completion of the professional degree. The Bachelor of Creative Intelligence and Innovation is not offered as a separate degree, but is completed only in combination with the professional degree program.",
