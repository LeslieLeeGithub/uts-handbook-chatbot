  "overview": "The Bachelor of Science Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Science Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) (C10243).\n\nThe Bachelor of Science Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is a combined degree in the sciences, language and culture. In the science component, students may select any one of the six different majors leading to the award of a science degree with the chosen major. Students can also opt not to choose a major but select a range of science subjects to tailor their study according to their interests.\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nStudents develop practical scientific and mathematical skills with an international dimension. International study is unique allowing students to gain qualifications in language and cultural awareness for a country of their choice. This added dimension expands students’ career opportunities and employability in the global workplace.",
