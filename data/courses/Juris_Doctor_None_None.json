  "overview": "The UTS Juris Doctor is an internationally recognised graduate-entry qualification for non-law graduates. As an Australian Qualifications Framework Level 9 master's qualification, this course meets the academic requirements for admission as a lawyer in NSW for graduates who have successfully completed a first degree.\n\nAs the foremost provider of JD education in Sydney, UTS delivers industry informed, academically rigorous and highly practical courses, equipping students with extensive knowledge in the theory and practice of the law. Flexible timetabling provides options for day and evening classes (core subjects), block study (selected subjects) and online learning (electives), as well as selected recorded lectures and podcasts.\n\nMentoring programs and co-curricular programs and services are also available to help keep students on track and to build students' career options. Practical Legal Training (PLT) – the practical requirement for admission as a lawyer to the Supreme Court of NSW – can also be completed at UTS. For students seeking a career path beyond the law, the JD can be an entry point into a range of other roles where legal expertise is of value.",
