  "overview": "For those interested in investigating world issues like politics, climate change or global relations, and sharing them with the public, journalism is an exciting and broad career option. It combines skills in writing, production, research and critical thinking to develop students’ capacities to frame world issues and affairs in accessible and relevant ways. UTS teaches journalism on the principle that it is a public good, and that any functional society requires a free and robust media. We encourage our graduates to be critical thinkers and train them in the ethical, intellectual, and political foundations needed to start their professional lives.\n\nSituated in the heart of Sydney in close proximity to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the Bachelor of Communication (Journalism) is a practice-based course, providing opportunities to engage with real reporting through UTS Central News and industry leaders like the ABC, The Guardian and more. The Bachelor of Communication (Journalism) gives students a crucial understanding of the role journalists play in a democracy, with journalism providing a forum for public debate and giving voice to all communities. Through hands-on practice, students also gain the skills in production, digital content creation, news reporting and analysis and writing required to excel in this diverse industry. These skills can be applied in various media platforms, including online, audio, television, video, print and social media.",
