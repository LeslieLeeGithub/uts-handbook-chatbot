  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Architecture is the first of two degrees needed to become an architect. Students wishing to qualify for professional recognition as architects must also complete the Master of Architecture (C04235).\n\nThrough the Bachelor of Design in Architecture, students learn what it means to be an architect in a globalised world. This is achieved with a focus on how the profession can shape global cities through complex spatial thinking.\n\nThe first step is to deprogram preconceived ideas of architecture. Such an approach lays the foundations for creative spatial and material awareness, pushing the boundaries of traditional architectural practice.\n\nUTS takes a hands-on approach to digital design and fabrication: students learn the software, material and model-making skills required to translate thought into form, right from the start. They have the opportunity to work on real-life projects and engage with stakeholders such as the Powerhouse Museum, ABC, Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (SHFA), and Sydney Olympic Park Authority.\n\nStudents are globally connected, with opportunities to study in, work in or visit cities such as Berlin, Los Angeles, New York and Tokyo. They hear from international experts through guest lectures and are connected to global competitions and scholarships like the Cosentino Design Challenge or Frank Gehry internship program.\n\nUTS Architecture is a vibrant architecture school, situated in one of Australia's newest, leading-edge campuses. Its staff are actively engaged in the industry as practitioners, researchers, and commentators, while its 24-hour studios are always abuzz with students who live and breathe architecture.",
