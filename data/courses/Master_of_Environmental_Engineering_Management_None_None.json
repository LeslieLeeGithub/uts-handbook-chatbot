  "overview": "This course is designed to enable engineers and other technical specialists to take a leadership role in the field of environmental engineering and management. The course deals with the broad aspects of environmental management relevant to practising professionals in engineering science, planning, architecture, law, surveying, health and building. Engineers, scientists, town planners and other professionals working in this field have a compelling duty to ensure that the adverse effects of development on the total environment are minimised.\n\nThe duration of the course is one-and-a-half years; however, applicants with a recognised bachelor's degree in engineering or the natural and physical sciences are eligible for recognition of prior learning of up to four subjects and are thus able to complete the course in one year on a full-time basis.\n\nThe course combines a set of key subjects that contain information on the nature of environmental problems together with engineering techniques for their solution. This is supplemented by management and policy subjects to empower the engineer, or technical specialist, to lead multidisciplinary teams working in the field of environmental engineering and management.\n\nThe course follows an integrated approach to professional practice through professional engineering subjects, subjects relating to environmental engineering management, an independent project, and a set of electives.",
