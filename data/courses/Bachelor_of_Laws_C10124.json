  "overview": "The Bachelor of Laws is one of Sydney's leading law degrees. It has been developed to help students build foundational knowledge in the practice of law, as well as the 'soft' skills (problem solving, analytical thinking, spoken and written communication) required to succeed in a legal career.\n\nStudents gain a fundamental understanding of the Australian legal system, as well as essential knowledge of common law principles. The course meets the academic requirements for admission to practise as a lawyer in NSW.\n\nElective subjects enable students to tailor their degree to areas of personal interest – these include law electives, such an environmental law, human rights law, a major in legal futures and technology, or electives from other disciplines – and develop a complementary skill set that enhance their professional prospects.",
