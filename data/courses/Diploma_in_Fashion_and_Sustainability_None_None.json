  "overview": "The Diploma of Fashion and Sustainability provides students with a robust foundation in sustainability issues in fashion. It offers an entry into the fashion industry, and it is also a potential pathway into the renowned Bachelor of Design in Fashion and Textiles degree.\n\nThe Diploma introduces students to conceptual research and design development in fashion, garment-making, and fashion illustration skills. Students’ fashion studies are framed with design as a force for change in different systems. Students work in world-class fashion workshops with close supervision of expert staff. Upon completion students understand fashion’s significant role in realising sustainable futures.\n\nThis is currently the only diploma on fashion and sustainability offered by a public university in Australia. It builds on the global reputation that UTS has in fashion education, and gives students access to high-quality facilities and internationally renowned academic staff. The diploma gives students relevant skills with real-world applications for employment or for further study.",
