  "overview": "The Bachelor of Management Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Management Bachelor of International Studies (C10343).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nThis combined degree enables students to travel and study abroad for the equivalent of two semesters, located with one of UTS’s partner universities. It is therefore distinctive in offering both tertiary education and life experience in two countries. The course develops deep knowledge of the entertainment and experience industries while combining direct exposure to their application in different cultures and economies.",
