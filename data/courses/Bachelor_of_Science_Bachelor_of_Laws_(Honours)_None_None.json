  "overview": "The Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Laws (Honours) is offered jointly by UTS Law and UTS Science. The law is of special importance in many areas of science, including research, industrial and commercial enterprise.\n\nHonours relates to the law component only and students must successfully complete both of the research subjects: 76090 Research Methodology and 76040 Research Thesis. Strong research skills are valued highly in contemporary professional practice.\n\nThe program provides full-time study for students wishing to obtain a professional legal qualification that satisfies the academic requirements only for admission as a lawyer together with a science specialisation.\n\nThe course addresses the increasing need for scientific expertise among lawyers. Graduates develop critical and analytical skills necessary when making decisions as they understand the complex links between science and law, increasing their employment prospects and career opportunities in both fields.\n\nStudents have the opportunity to engage in deeper study of the law by studying 76090 Research Methodology and undertaking 76040 Research Thesis. This course can be a pathway to higher degree research programs.",

The study components for course completion are as follows.\n\nThe law component of 144 credit points is made up of:\n\nThe science component comprises 96 credit points of core science subjects taken from one of 10 specified majors representing different science disciplines.\n\nStudents graduate from the BSc independently from the LLB. However, to be eligible for graduation from the BSc students must complete one of the 96-credit-point UTS: Science majors plus at least 96 credit points of Bachelor of Law subjects.\n\nGraduation from the science component of the combined degree is not possible prior to completion of all components of the combined degree. Students wishing to graduate with a Bachelor of Science prior to completion of the law component of the combined degree must apply for transfer to the Bachelor of Science (C10242) single degree program where they must complete all requirements for the stand-alone single degree version.\n\nSimilarly, a student can graduate from the law component of the combined degree prior to completion of the science component, but if they wish to continue with the science component, they must apply for transfer to the Bachelor of Science (C10242) single degree program where they need to complete all requirements for the stand-alone single degree version.\n\nFor a current listing of subjects in each course refer to the study package directory.",
