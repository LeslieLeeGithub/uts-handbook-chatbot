  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Product Design Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Design in Product Design Bachelor of International Studies (C10305).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nUTS believes a hands-on approach is fundamental for every aspiring designer. As such, the students' starting point is the individual design and making of an object. Throughout their studies students learn how to design, prototype and test solutions using the latest technologies in the faculty's digital and fabrication workshops.\n\nAlongside a strong technical base, the degree applies the creative problem-solving required to design experiences that make a difference to everyday life, whether in developing economies or digital cultures. Central to this approach is an understanding of the relationships between objects, culture, economy, technology, business and human behaviour.\n\nA further two years of study introduce and consolidate the learning of a language and culture other than English.",
