  "overview": "The Bachelor of Design in Interior Architecture helps students to re-imagine interior environments and public spaces in local and global contexts. With a strong emphasis on people's experiences of spatial design, this degree equips students with the critical skills required to interrogate and transgress the traditional boundaries of commercial interior design.\n\nStudents learn to engage with public and urban spaces alongside internal environments. Contemporary societies and city environments are changing rapidly, and this course promotes the ability to adapt to this change and shape the way people experience interior and public spaces.\n\nThrough a strong emphasis on practice and research, students develop the ability to think conceptually and understand the complex contexts in which they are designing. Through intensive collaborative design studios, students work to develop, discuss and debate ideas as they would in industry. With skills in analogue and digital design and fabrication, they are able to tackle real-world projects in the studios as well as through competitions with stakeholders such as the Art Gallery of NSW, Object Gallery, the City of Sydney and Zumtobel Lighting.\n\nInternational connections and focus encourage recognition of UTS graduates abroad. UTS academics lead yearly international design studios in cities such as Berlin, Hong Kong, Athens, Prague and Venice. International guest lectures and workshops, as well as a wide range of exchange opportunities, enrich students' learning and expose them to different cultures of design.",
