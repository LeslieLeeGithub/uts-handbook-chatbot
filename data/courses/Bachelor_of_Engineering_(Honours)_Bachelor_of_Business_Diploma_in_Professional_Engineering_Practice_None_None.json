  "overview": "This combined degree provides students with the opportunity to complete the core and major components of both the engineering and business degrees. This course is essentially the same as the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Bachelor of Business (C09070) combined degree except for the additional requirement of two internships and the completion of the professional engineering practice program. The professional engineering practice program is integrated throughout the course.\n\nFor graduates choosing to practise as engineers, the business knowledge is invaluable in providing a sound foundation for entrepreneurial initiatives and the commercialisation of engineering innovations.\n\nThis combined degree can be completed in less time than would be required to complete the two degrees separately.",
