  "overview": "Journalism operates within a complex set of ethical and legal boundaries. Understanding the law and how it impacts professional journalistic practice is essential to both journalism and media-specific legal careers.\n\nThis degree provides students with the knowledge and the practical skills required to become highly effective practitioners in either professional discipline, and meets the academic requirements for admission to practice law in NSW.\n\nCourse content combines the intellectual, ethical and political foundations of journalism with the study of Australian legal theory and practice. Students learn to produce multi-platform journalism stories and build exceptional communication skills that are also applicable in the legal profession, including in research, writing and analysis.\n\nElective choices include media-specific law subjects, cross-disciplinary communication subjects, or the Legal Futures and Technology major.\n\nGraduates can pursue careers in media and communications legal practice, policy and research work; specialist legal and crime reporting and publishing for print, internet, radio or television; and legal communications or publishing in the private sector.",
