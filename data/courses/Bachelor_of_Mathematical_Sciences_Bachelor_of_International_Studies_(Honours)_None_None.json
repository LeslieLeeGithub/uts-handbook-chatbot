  "overview": "The Bachelor of Mathematical Sciences Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Mathematical Sciences Bachelor of International Studies (C10458).\n\nThe course is an exciting combined degree in mathematical sciences, language and cultures. It enables students with a strong interest in mathematics, statistics, and data to grow and develop skills that are in high demand in the modern work force. The basis is a comprehensive foundation of core mathematical competencies, combined with one of four Majors, ensuring graduates have the knowledge and skills to develop and adapt in the rapidly changing work environment.\n\nMathematical Sciences focuses on the application of mathematical techniques to real-world problems. The core provides a broad mathematical foundation, while each major provides depth of study. International study is unique allowing students to gain qualifications in language and cultural awareness for a country of their choice. This added dimension expands students’ career opportunities and employability in the global workplace.\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nThe core provides a broad mathematical foundation, while each major provides depth of study. International studies is unique, allowing students to gain qualifications in language and cultural awareness relating to a country of their choice. This added dimension expands students’ career opportunities and employability in the global workplace.",
