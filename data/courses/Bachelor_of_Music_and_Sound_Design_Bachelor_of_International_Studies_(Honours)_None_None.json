  "overview": "The Bachelor of Music and Sound Design Bachelor of International Studies (Honours) is an exit-point for students who have completed the International Honours pathway within the Bachelor of Music and Sound Design Bachelor of International Studies (C10277).\n\nIn the fourth year of the combined degree, International Honours students spend an academic year studying in the local language at a university in the country of their major and also complete an honours level research project under the supervision of a relevant UTS academic.\n\nEntry to the International Honours pathway is dependent on students maintaining a credit average (or higher) in both their International Studies and professional degree in their first three years of study, and on the availability of placements in particular majors.\n\nWorking with UTS’s specialist sound facilities and equipment in the creative precinct of inner-Sydney, students develop and advance their interest in popular music, sound design, sound engineering and interactive media. Throughout the course students build a portfolio of sound works that demonstrates their creativity and professional skills to employers. They will have opportunities to run a music label, record in professional sound studios, collaborate with likeminded students in both this course and other disciplines, and design and compose sound and music for film, games and digital media. This is a future-focused course that provides students with the tools to succeed in the industry of today and tomorrow.",
