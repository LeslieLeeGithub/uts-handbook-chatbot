  "overview": "The two-year, graduate entry coursework Master of Genetic Counselling is the entry-level qualification for work as a genetic counsellor. This program is developed and delivered by experienced genetic counsellors, supported by expert learning designers, broad consultation with the genetic counselling profession and a skilled Curriculum Advisory Committee.\n\nThe program is delivered in a way that actively supports students to study from their home areas by utilising a combination of asynchronous interactive online learning and synchronous weekly, timetabled ‘live and online’ classes, supported with a week-long block each session. Expert guest lecturers participate throughout the course, ensuring relevance and real-world application of coursework. Block learning takes place in the Graduate School of Health's education and research facility at UTS City campus or online.\n\nAlongside the coursework, students participate in clinical placements, sourced by UTS, throughout the two-year program. Placements are offered in a variety of settings in Australasia and may include the option of an approved international placement for interested students. Placements are supported by weekly reflective practice supervision. Students undertake research training to equip them with the skills to provide evidence-based care, talk with clients about research participation and findings and seek opportunities for higher degree research in the future.",
