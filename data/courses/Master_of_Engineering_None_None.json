  "overview": "This course provides an opportunity at master's level for professional engineers to deepen the knowledge and skills gained in their undergraduate studies while expanding their managerial and professional engineering knowledge.\n\nThe course follows an integrated approach to professional practice through disciplinary and professional engineering subjects, subjects relating to the chosen major, an independent project, and a set of electives. Students who wish to undertake a more substantial research project have the opportunity to transfer to the Master of Engineering (Advanced) (C04278).\n\nThis course allows students to choose a program of study that deepens the body of knowledge acquired in their first degree as well as expands knowledge boundaries into policy and engineering management areas. It also provides an opportunity to deepen their knowledge and gain practical skills by undertaking an independent project in the field of their major.",
