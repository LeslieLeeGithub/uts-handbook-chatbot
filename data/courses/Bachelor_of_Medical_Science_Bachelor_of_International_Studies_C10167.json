  "overview": "The Bachelor of Medical Science Bachelor of International Studies is a combined degree that integrates medical science with the immersion in another language and culture. The medical science program is designed to educate and train graduates for careers in medical and health-related sciences or pathology depending on their major choice. In the Medical and Health-related Science major students learn the body through the study of tissues, organs and cellular facets both in health and disease, medical devices, how medicines work, as well as public health policies and clinical trials. In the Pathology major students learn how diseases trigger biochemical or cellular changes in the body and how to best diagnose and treat these diseases. Students learn by applying and investigating scientific approaches in world class laboratories with up-to-date scientific technologies and equipment in line with those used in the industry. This hands-on learning is accompanied by development of professional skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and innovation that means the students are ideally placed for a range of professions.\n\nIn the International Studies, students select one of six languages (Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, or Spanish) and one of the following three pathways: Language, Culture & the Professional World, Language; Culture & Global Exchange; and International Honours.\n\nThe combination of medical science and international studies aims to produce graduates with an increased awareness of the international contexts of health and who are well prepared to pursue global health-related professional careers. The course provides the knowledge and skills for students to be excellent medical scientists, but also with an excellent language and international skills set, meaning graduates can make a difference to society in a range of careers with a global and international context.\n\nMultinational pharmaceutical companies look to medical science graduates to work in drug registration, clinical trials coordination, as technical or marketing representatives and as policy analysts. International health initiatives involving governments or non-government organisations also look for the unique skills provided by this dual degree.",
